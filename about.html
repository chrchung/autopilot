            N-way matching is the process of combining multiple software models into one.


            An example of n-way matching is depicted in below, in which three mockups of a hospital system (i.e, M1, M2, M3) are grouped
            together via dotted and solid lines: <br>

            Although the problem has practical importance in software engineering practices, it is considered
            intractable; that is, the problem is deemed difficult for a computer to solve.
            Matchmakers empowers people to solve n-way matching, by encoding the problem as a cute game.
